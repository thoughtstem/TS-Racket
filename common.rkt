  "<p>Learn to <b>build and code robots</b> using the RoKit, designed locally in San Diego by our friends at Robolink. Students will work in teams as they learn and apply both mechanical and software engineering principles. Students will complete a variety of challenges like maze navigation, line following, and sumo competitions. </p>\n<p>There is so much to learn about robotics! That's why this summer we have an A, B, and C version of this camp. Each camp covers different material, so take one camp or all three!<b>This camp is Version A.</b></p>\n<p>We will send daily email reports with the code that students worked on in camp that day, so that they can keep coding at home. After camp, we'll also provide students with information to purchase a robotics kit for continued learning at home.</p>")
