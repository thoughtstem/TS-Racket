  '("Book titled: How to Convert A Well-Educated Atheist.  Written to an
  audience of Christians.  It's a trap though.  Focuses on loving
understanding
of atheist positions and attacks, how to defend.  But the whole thing will
secretly advance a style of loving discourse the effect of which will be that
Christians will learn more about the arguments that tend to convert people
to atheism.  Forces them to see it from the other side.
They think they're learning how to convert, but will end up
being converted themselves."

    "How to pick up a barista.  Book that pretends to be a PUA book, but
really advances feminism."

    "How to Convince Someone There Are Only Two Genders.
Secretly a book to educate conservatives about the subtlties of language.
