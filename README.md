# TS-Racket

Note: If you found this repo because it's public on github, please be aware
that most of it won't work out of the box without special API keys. 

The only reason it's public is that we care about computer science education,
and the more Racket-based code examples in the world, the better.  So feel
free to use it for educational purposes.  Just be aware that it's not going to
work for you the way the documentation suggests that it will.  

However, if you found this repo because you work for ThoughtSTEM, welcome!
Ask for an API key and let's get started!
